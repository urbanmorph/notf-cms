## Ward-to-Corporation Mapping Challenge

**Issue**: The grievance data contains 199 wards but doesn't include corporation assignment.

**Solution Applied**: Created manual mapping based on geographic knowledge:
- Matched ~57% of wards to corporations
- Remaining 43% categorized as "Unknown" due to:
  - Ward name ambiguities
  - New ward formations
  - Need for official GBA delimitation mapping

**Recommendation**: Import official GBA ward delimitation data (available at opencity.in) for 100% accurate mapping.

---

## Data Quality Notes

1. **Completeness**: 2025 data only covers Jan-June (partial year)
2. **Status Categories**: Most complaints marked "Closed" vs "Resolved" - unclear distinction
3. **Ward Names**: Some inconsistencies in naming conventions
4. **Corporation Mapping**: Requires official GBA mapping for complete accuracy

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Obtain Official Mapping**: Download GBA ward delimitation from opencity.in
2. **Calculate SLA Metrics**: Analyze time-to-resolution using date fields
3. **Seasonal Analysis**: Extract month/season patterns
4. **Staff Performance**: Analyze by staff names/teams
5. **Category Deep-Dive**: Subcategory analysis by corporation
6. **Citizen Satisfaction**: Survey link integration for feedback
